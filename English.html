    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
With the agreement that IBM shares <a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/informix">Informix</a> code with GBASE, this company is developing a new OLTP DBMS <a href="http://www.gbase.cn/product_center8t.html">GBase 8t</a> based on the Informix code.
      </li>
      <li>
Responsible for the partial development of GBase 8t kernel, with architecture related code focusing on x86_64/arm/aarch64 and the unrelated part on thread management, RSAM, SQL and some userspace tools. In the last year of employment, I start to maintain the
SDS cluster and Connection Manager code pieces within High Availability group.

      <li>
Most of my work done on Linux operating system with C and few Java programs.
      </li>
      <li>
All projects involved based on the Informix source code, the typical ones I took like writing parsers for introducing some Oracle SQL grammar and implementing its semantics, adding new builtin functions to Informix SQL, writing supplementary userspace tools which interacts with the database server for some administration tasks. Also I fixed several bugs found with original Informix code such as deadlock, memleak etc.
      </li>
      <li>
In addition to the original Informix building method, I succeeded in cross-compiling the entire GBase 8t for the arm/aarch64 single board computers. Also, we refined the boundaries of various components to enable pruning unneeded functions.
      </li>
      <li>
At end of each project, we will deliver technical notes, mind map or sequence diagram in the study of relevent Informix code and share on team talks.
